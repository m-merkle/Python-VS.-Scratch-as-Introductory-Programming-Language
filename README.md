# Advantages of utilizing Scratch over Python as a programming language to instruct K-12 students 
Included in this repository is a copy of my research paper that explores the use of Scratch and Python as introductory programming languages for K-12 students, comparing their effectiveness in teaching programming concepts. The paper examines how Scratch's visual, user-friendly interface helps engage young learners and fosters motivation, while also addressing the need for transitioning to Python to tackle more advanced programming concepts and build deeper skills.
